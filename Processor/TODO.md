# Todo list
- Fix delay model in both router and core
    - I also need to validate that both of these do what I expect them to do
- Create new mapping implementation that does not use actor, so totally decoupled
- Make splitted SRNN copyable
- Report utilization of routers and cores
- Some reporting to see congestion on the NoC
- Write multiple mapper implementations
- Maybe add sender process to core?
- Implement more benchamrks
- Implement proxy metrics
