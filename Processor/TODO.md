# Todo list
- Fix delay model in both router and core
    - Implement
        - [] Router
        - [x] Core
    - Validate
        - [] Router
        - [] Core
- Make splitted SRNN copyable
- Report utilization of routers and cores
- Some reporting to see congestion on the NoC
- Write multiple mapper implementations
    - [x] Simple splittable mapper implementation 
    - [x] Create new mapping implementation that does not use actor, so totally decoupled
    - [] Other strategies that are more optimal
- Maybe add sender process to core?
- Implement more benchamrks
- Implement proxy metrics
