# Todo list
- Fix delay model in both router and core
    - Implement
        - [] Router
        - [x] Core
    - Validate
        - [] Router
        - [] Core
- More mapping
    - [x] Simple splittable mapper implementation 
    - [x] Create new mapping implementation that does not use actor, so totally decoupled
    - [x] Integrate new mapper implementation with existing multi-core
    - [] Less finicky HW and SNN setup 
    - [] Research other mapping strategies
- HW
    - [] Maybe add sender process to core?
    - [x] Move controller of mesh
    - [] Move output layer to controller
- SNN
    - [x] Make splitted SRNN copyable
- More benchmarks
    - [] PS-MNIST
    - [] S-MNIST
    - [] ECG-QTDB
- Extra reporting
    - [] Implement proxy metrics
    - [x] Some reporting to see congestion on the NoC
        - [x] Spike travel times
        - [x] Debug why there are so few spikes in spike travel times
        - [] Debug why so many spikes have such a short travel delay
    - [] Report utilization of routers and cores
    - [x] Core compute delays
- Reporting
    - [] Write introduction & related work
    - [] Document current simulator
